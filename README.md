# Enginnering92-Sorters-Project

## About and usage:

In week 4 I worked on creating sort algorithms and implementing them into a sort manager.
First clone the repo and open the project in InteliJ.  
After running the main, the sort manager will ask the user how large an array they would like to generate.  
After validating the users choice, an array is generated and the user can choose a sorting algorithm.  
The array will then be sorted and the user will be presented with the randomly generated array, the sorted array and how long it took to perform.  
The project is designed in a way that allows new sorting algorithms to be added easily, and currently existing algorithms to be edited without affecting the other methods.  

## Currently implemented sorters:  

BubbleSort  
Binary Tree Sort  
Merge Sort  
Selection Sort  
Insertion Sort  
Quick Sort  
Java's inbuilt array sort  

## Known issues:  

Binary Tree Sort currently does not return the sorted array, but instead outputs them individually.
